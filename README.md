# Apache OpenServerless Streamer (incubating)

The OpenServerless streamer is a tool to relay a stream from OpenWhisk actions to an outside
HTTP client.

The streamer is a simple HTTP server that exposes an endpoint /stream/{namespace}/{action} to 
invoke the relative OpenWhisk action, open a socket for the action to write to, and relay the
output to the client.

It expects 2 environment variables to be set:
- `OW_APIHOST`: the OpenWhisk API host
- `STREAMER_ADDR`: the address of the streamer server for the OpenWhisk actions to connect to

Other environment variables can be set to configure the streamer:

- `HTTP_SERVER_PORT`: the port the streamer server listens on (default: 8181)


## Endpoints

The streamer exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /action/{namespace}/{action}`: to invoke the OpenWhisk action on the given namespace, default package, and action name. It requires an a Authorization header with Bearer token with the OpenWhisk AUTH token
- `POST /action/{namespace}/{package}/{action}`: to invoke the OpenWhisk action on the given namespace, custom package, and action name. It requires an a Authorization header with Bearer token with the OpenWhisk AUTH token

- `POST /web/{namespace}/{action}`: to invoke an OpenWhisk web action on the given namespace, default package, and action name.
- `POST /web/{namespace}/{package}/{action}`: to invoke an OpenWhisk web action on the given namespace, custom package, and action name.
